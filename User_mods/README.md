#Goose Belt Purger - User mods
Files in this folder are user mods related to the Goose Belt Purger. Although they have been curated by me (Graylag) and have been confirmed to meet certain minimum standards, they are not considered a core part of the project and are neither developed nor maintaned by the GBP team.  
All credit goes to the original authors of these mods. If you have any questions or ideas, please try to contact the original authors. Our Discord server might be an ideal place to do that.  
  
Would you like to have your mod here? Contact me on Discord (username graylag) or send me an email. I reserve the right to not publish every submission, but if your work meets minimum qzality requirements and can be helpful to someone, I will try to publish it.
